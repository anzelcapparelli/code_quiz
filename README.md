# Code Quiz

![Start Page](assets/images/code_quiz_intro.png)

## Description
This project primarily demonstrates prolific element generation via javascript, and interactability via eventListeners. Additionally, DOM traversal and querySelectors play a big part in the functionality of the quiz.

Both setInterval and local storage access were touched upon in this app, for both the timer and the high score storage, respectively.
